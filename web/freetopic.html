                <h1> ULTRAVIOLENCE </h1>
                <p>This is one of my favorite records, called ULTRAVIOLENCE <br>
                it has the perfect combination between melancholic <br> 
                tones and guitar solo, for me the best song to listen <br>
                for the firts time from this record is <span style="color:darkred">WEST COAST</span>

                <p>
                This is another one of my favorites, called NORMAN FUC**** ROCKWELL <br>
                This is the album that led her to her first GRAMMYS nomination, <br> 
                although she did not get the statue, it was through this album<br>
                that her career grew and she obtained more recognition.<br>
                for me, the best song to listen to for the firts time <br>
                from this record is <span style="color:darkred">VENICE BITCH</span>
